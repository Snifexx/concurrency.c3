# concurrency.c3<br>Yet another concurrency library for C3

> [!WARNING]
> This library is not production ready, I literally just rolled it in a day, so W.I.P.

## Project Distribution

For the time being, the project is not bundled into a c3l, as I use my own build system make3 (which is basically nob.h).
The library is all contained in [a single file](src/concurrency.c3)

## Examples
Examples are all in the [test](test/) directory. You can run all tests with `c3c compile-run build.c3 make3.c3 -o make3`
